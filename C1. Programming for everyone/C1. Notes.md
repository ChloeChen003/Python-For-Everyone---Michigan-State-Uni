## 2.4 Statement 语句

1. expression statement e.g. print
2. assignment statement 

## 2.5 Operators and operands 运算符和运算对象
+
-
*
、
**
### 2.8 Modulus operator  模运算

quotient = 7 // 3
>>> print(quotient)
2
>>> remainder = 7 % 3
>>> print(remainder)
1

## 2.6 Expressions 
x + 17

## 2.7 order of operations 
运算顺序由优先级规则来确定。 对于数学运算符来说，Python遵照数学运算习惯，即“括号、次方、乘除、加减”。
    3*1**3等于3，而不是27。

## 2.9 String operations
>>> first = 10
>>> second = 15
>>> print(first+second)
25
>>> first = '100'
>>> second = '150'
>>> print(first + second)
100150

## 2.10 Asking for user for input 
>>> inp = input()
Some silly stuff
>>> print(inp)
Some silly stuff

>>> name = input('What is your name?\n')
What is your name?
Chuck
>>> print(name)
Chuck

## 2.1 choosing mnemonic variables names 助记变量命名法
>>>for word in words:
>>>     print(word)

>>>for slice in pizza:
>>>     print(slice)

# Chapter 3. Conditional Execution 
## 3.1 Boolean expression 
**True or False**
!= 
>
<
>= 
<=
x is y
x is not y

>>> 5 == 5
True
>>> 5 == 6
False

>>> type(True)
<class 'bool'>
>>> type(False)
<class 'bool'>

## 3.2 Logical operators
3 logical operators: **and, or, not**

>>> x = 1
>>> y = 2
>>> x > y
False
>>> not (x > y)
True

**Any nonzero number is interpreted as “true.”**
>>> 17 and True
True

## 3.3 conditional execution 
if statement + condition 
compound statement 

`` `if x > 0 :
        print('x is positive')`` `

## 3.4 alternative execution 
if ... else... statement 

if x % 2 == 0:
    print('x is even')
else:
    print('x is odd')

## 3.5 chained conditionals 
if ... elif ... else 

if x < y:
    fprint('x is less than y')
elif x > y:
    print('x is greater than y')
else:
    print('x and y are equal')

## 3.6 nested conditionals 

if x == y:
    print('x and y are equal')
else:
    if x < y:
        print('x is less than y')
    else:
        print('x is greater than y')

In general, we suggest to avoid nested conditionals when can, as they become difficult to read very quickly. Above can be rewrited to below 
if 0 < x:
    if x < 10:
        print('x is a positive single-digit number.')

if 0 < x and x < 10:
    print('x is a positive single-digit number.')
